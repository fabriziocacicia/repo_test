        prBody: |
          The commit $LATEST_COMMIT_HASH doesn't follow the [Conventional Commit convention](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). 
          Because of that, it was removed from the history of the repository.
         
          Please, squash this PR updating the commit message so that it follows the convention.
